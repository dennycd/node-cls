# Simple Javascript Class System for Node.js 

node-cls is a simple class system that adds a number of object-oriented features to the basic javascript language, including
1. convinient class definition with inheritance
2. abstract class a.k.a. interface support
3. runtime introspection with dynamic type checking

The design goal is to provide a clean and easily understandable class system while minimizing overhead and avoid poluting the javascript built-in objects. It is inspired and built upon the defineClass from [JavaScript The Definitive Guide](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805531.do). 

## Usage

Install the package "simple-cls"
```javascript
npm install simple-cls
```
To define a class, do the following 
```javascript
var cls = require('simple-cls')

var MyClass = cls.defineClass({
	//optional class name 
	name : "MyClass",
	//optional super class, default is Object
	extend : BaseClass,
	//constructor code
	construct : function(msg){
		this.msg = msg;
	}, 
	//instance methods
	methods: {  
		foo: function() {
			console.log("foo");
		}
	},
	//instance variables
	variables: {
		bar : 1,
		msg : null
	},
	// class level variables or methods
	statics : {
		
	}
});
```

To instantiate an object and start using it  
```javascript
var obj = new MyClass("hello");
obj.foo();
console.log(obj.bar);
```


## Concept

![Concept](https://raw.github.com/dennycd/node-cls/master/doc/node-cls.001.png "Concept")


in node-cls, the class system is built upon a chain of triple objects, namely the  **Prototype**, **Constructor** and **Class**. As the diagram shows, instantiating a new js object will establish a relationship from the bottom up, starting at the object instance. Using javascript's built-in function we can obtain the prototype of that object.
```javascript
assert.ok(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) === MyClass.prototype);)
```
The prototype object itself is an object instance of the superclass of MyClass. If no superclass is given, it is defaulted to `Object`. `MyClass` is an alias of the **Constructor** function for obj
```javascript 
assert.ok(obj.constructor === MyClass)
``` 

The **Class** object contains runtime information about the obj class and can be obtained via `__class` on the constructor or `.getClass()` methods 
```javascript
assert.ok(obj.constructor.__class === obj.getClass())
```

To check if a js object is an instance of a class, or an instance of a subclass of some super classes 
```javascript
test.ok(obj.getClass().isKindOfClass('MyClass'));
test.ok(obj.getClass().isKindOfClass('BaseClass'));
test.ok(obj.getClass().isKindOfClass(MyClass.__class));
test.ok(obj.getClass().isKindOfClass(BaseClass.__class));
```

To look at all the methods callable from the obj, including methods defined on the super class
```javascript 
console.log(obj.getClass().getMethods());
```

For details, please look at the unit test examples.
