# Simple Javascript Class System for Node.js 

node-cls is a simple class system that adds a number of object-oriented features to the basic javascript language, including
* convinient class definition with inheritance
* abstract class / interface support
* runtime introspection with dynamic type checking

The design goal is to provide a clean and easily understandable class system while minimizing overhead or poluting the javascript built-in objects. It is inspired and built upon the defineClass from [JavaScript The Definitive Guide](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805531.do).
